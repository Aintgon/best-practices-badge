[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.build_reproducible.description] "It is SUGGESTED that the project have a <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible build</a>. If no building occurs (e.g., scripting languages where the source code is used directly instead of being compiled), select "not applicable" (N/A).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.build_reproducible.details] "A reproducible build means that multiple parties can independently redo the process of generating information from source files and get exactly the same bit-for-bit result.  In some cases, this can be resolved by forcing some sort order. JavaScript developers may consider using npm shrinkwrap and webpack OccurenceOrderPlugin.  GCC and clang users may find the -frandom-seed option useful.  The build environment (including the toolset) can often be defined for external parties by specifying the cryptographic hash of a specific container or virtual machine that they can use for rebuilding. The <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/">reproducible builds project has documentation on how to do this</a>.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.crypto_certificate_verification.description] "The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports TLS, perform TLS certificate verification by default when using TLS, including on subresources. If the software does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.crypto_certificate_verification.details] "Note that incorrect TLS certificate verification is a common mistake. For more information, see <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html">"The Most Dangerous Code in the World: Validating SSL Certificates in Non-Browser Software" by Martin Georgiev et al.</a> and <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/03/12/do-you-trust-this-application/">"Do you trust this application?" by Michael Catanzaro</a>.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.crypto_tls12.description] "The software produced by the project SHOULD, if it supports or uses TLS, support at least TLS version 1.2. Note that the predecessor of TLS was called SSL. If the software does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.crypto_used_network.description] "The software produced by the project SHOULD support secure protocols for all of its network communications, such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP, and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 SHOULD be disabled by default, and only enabled if the user specifically configures it. If the software produced by the project does not support network comunications, select "not applicable" (N/A).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.crypto_verification_private.description] "The software produced by the project SHOULD, if it supports TLS, perform certificate verification before sending HTTP headers with private information (such as secure cookies). If the software does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.hardened_site.description] "It is SUGGESTED that the project website, repository (if accessible via the web), and download site (if separate) include key hardening headers with nonpermissive values.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.hardened_site.details] "Note that GitHub is known to meet this. Sites such as https://securityheaders.io/ can quickly check this. The key hardening headers are: Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options (as "nosniff"), X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.hardening.description] "It is SUGGESTED that hardening mechanisms be used in the software produced by the project so that software defects are less likely to result in security vulnerabilities.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.hardening.details] "Hardening mechanisms may include HTTP headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), compiler flags to mitigate attacks (such as -fstack-protector), or compiler flags to eliminate undefined behavior. For our purposes least privilege is not considered a hardening mechanism (least privilege is important, but separate).
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.installation_common.description] "The project SHOULD provide a way to easily install and uninstall the software produced by the project using a commonly-used convention.
"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [criteria.0.installation_common.details] "Examples include using a package manager (at the system or language level), "make install/uninstall" (supporting DESTDIR), a container in a standard format, or a virtual machine image in a standard format. The installation and uninstallation process (e.g., its packaging) MAY be implemented by a third party as long as it is FLOSS.
"
[de,es,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [error_messages.begin_with_cpe] " must begin with "cpe:""
[de,es,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [error_messages.comma_separated_list] " must be a comma-separated list of names"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [headings.OSS License] "OSS License"
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [static_pages.criteria.criteria_must_should_suggested] "Among active criteria, there are %{must} MUST, %{should} SHOULD, and %{suggested} SUGGESTED criteria."
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [static_pages.criteria.criteria_na_met_details] "Among active criteria, %{na_allowed} allow N/A, %{met_url_required} require a URL when met, and %{details_present} have details in their description."
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [static_pages.criteria.current_criteria] "Current number of criteria: %{active} (active) + %{future} (future) = %{total} (total)."
[de,fr,ja,ru,zh-CN] [static_pages.criteria.project_counts] "There are %{projects} project entries; %{passing} are passing and %{in_progress} are in progress."
